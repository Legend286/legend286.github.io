### What Is a "Known Unknown"?

In 1976, Dr. Miriam Keel — a linguist contracted by The Bureau — coined the term "Known Unknown" while working on the Euphrates Excavation. The phrase first appeared in a note scrawled beside a fragmented tablet that read, in translation:

> "We worshipped what we knew, and feared what we did not. But we obeyed that which we could neither name nor forget."

A Known Unknown is, simply put, something you *know* exists — or existed — but for which all explanation or understanding is missing. A gap not in reality, but in our grasp of it.

### Examples You May Already Know

- **The Voynich Manuscript:** Decades of cryptographic effort. No definitive decryption. Carbon dated. Real ink, real paper — unreal language.
- **Numbers Stations:** Shortwave radio channels broadcasting endless strings of numbers, tones, and words. Still active. No explanation.
- **Bloop Recording (1997):** Deep-ocean hydrophones captured a sound louder than any animal on Earth. Source: unknown. Depth: unreachable.

These, and thousands more, are indexed beneath the KNOWN UNKNOWN protocol — filed in the cracks between scientific theory, historical fact, and supernatural folklore.

### Purpose of This Dossier

This document is designed to introduce clearance-level-zero personnel — civilians, interns, low-threat agents — to the wider framework of anomaly classification. It may be distributed under supervised Bureau conditions or via approved ARG dissemination protocols (see: MEMETIC FILTER C-12).

By understanding the **patterns of absence** — the events and entities that persist despite deliberate erasure — we can begin to piece together the shape of the world we *were never meant to see*.

Welcome to the archive.

And remember: *just because it’s redacted, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.*
