# SIGNAL DOSSIER – “THE NUMBERS FIEND”

**Threat Designation:** SIGNAL CLASS OMEGA // MEMETIC VECTOR ANOMALY  
**Code Name:** “The Numbers Fiend”  
**First Detected:** April 13, 1959  
**Current Status:** Active (Irregular Transmissions)  
**Compiled by:** Bureau Auditory Surveillance Division (ASD-1)  
**File ID:** SIG-NF-1959-DELTA

---

## 📡 DESCRIPTION

**The Numbers Fiend** refers to a persistent, untraceable shortwave broadcast that began in **1959**, broadcasting sequences of numbers, tones, and names in monotone voices across a shifting range of global frequencies.

- **Signal Format:**  
  - 4–12 digit number strings (no obvious mathematical logic)  
  - Sporadic names (in multiple languages, dead and modern)  
  - Ended with a tone or distorted click  
  - Cycles last between 3–17 minutes; occasionally loop

- **Transmission Type:**  
  Not consistent with known radio hardware. Frequencies occasionally spill into **non-physical audio ranges**, perceptible only via analog receivers or exposed human perception under stress.

> “The numbers don’t mean anything. It’s the silence between them that counts.”  
> 
> – Agent Rosa Liu, Audio Division Debrief (1982)

## 🔪 CORRELATED DEATHS

Between 1959–1987, Bureau monitoring confirmed **at least 214 individuals** died within 24 hours of their full name being broadcast by the Fiend.

### Common Death Triggers:
- Spontaneous aneurysm
- Suicidal psychosis
- “Accidental” falls from secure locations
- Disappearance (body unrecovered, but environment shows no exit)

**NOTABLE CASE (1963):**  
U.S. Senator Alan M. Trow’s name was transmitted 2 hours before a televised stroke. Rewind footage shows the exact number string **flashing once** in his pupil reflection, undetectable in real-time.

## 🧬 SIGNAL PROPERTIES

| Frequency Band | Description | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 2312 kHz       | “Primary Feed” – audio distortion, clearest broadcast | HIGH |
| 3327 kHz       | Subharmonic ghosting layer – backward whispering | MODERATE |
| 4171 kHz       | Name-only rapid burst channel | CRITICAL |
| 0 Hz (Silent Band) | Dead-air between signals – triggers sleep paralysis in 6% of test subjects | EXTREME |

## 🧠 COGNITIVE EFFECTS

- Hearing broadcast more than **three times** results in:
  - Compulsive counting behaviors
  - Recursive dream loops
  - Perception of time slowing or repeating
  - Emergence of foreign memories belonging to "someone with your name"

- Subjects exposed long-term to Numbers Fiend develop **mild precognitive tendencies**, followed by irreversible emotional flatlining and eventual **auditory self-deletion** (described in logs as “disconnecting from voice”).

## 🛰️ COVER-UP OPERATIONS

### OPERATION: JAM-SIGHT (1964–1999)
- Bureau deployed manufactured ham radios prone to interference
- Civilian Numbers Stations flooded frequencies with decoys
- Bureau employees embedded in global radio hobbyist communities to discredit or “debunk” Fiend exposure
- Fake academic term introduced: **“Apophenic Drift Syndrome”** — now used as cover story for exposure victims

> “Let them believe it’s just Cold War paranoia. If they knew the names were *real*, we’d have a collapse on our hands.”  
> 
> – Director Ansel V., 1977

## 🧾 SURVIVOR TESTIMONY – AGENT FALCO (RETIRED)

> “You never hear your own name the first time.  
> You hear someone else say it — in a voice you haven’t heard yet.  
> Then the number sequence plays, and that’s *you*.  
> It’s not a prediction. It’s a time bomb with a voice attached.”

## 🔐 SIGNAL CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS

- All Bureau analog radios monitored for frequency bleed  
- MEMETIC FILTER C-12 or higher required for signal review  
- Signal recordings stored in sealed audio vaults at Black Site 11  
- No staff permitted to *transcribe* broadcasts while playing — transcription triggers dream recursion

- ⚠️ **DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BROADCAST ALONE.**  
  Instances of the signal adapting itself to personal speaker systems have been logged.

## 🧾 ARCHIVIST NOTE

> “The Numbers Fiend doesn’t want to be heard.  
> It wants to be *counted*.  
> The moment it says your name, you’re added to a list no one alive remembers creating.”
