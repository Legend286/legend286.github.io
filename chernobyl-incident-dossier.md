## üî• OVERVIEW

Publicly reported as the most catastrophic nuclear accident in history, the **Chernobyl disaster** was, in truth, a **containment breach of a dormant Rift-node**, buried beneath Reactor No. 4 during construction.

### Key Notes:
- Reactor site chosen *despite clear geophysical red flags* ‚Äî leaked Bureau memos suggest Soviet Division –Ø-0 deliberately built atop dormant anomaly site codenamed **"BURNT CROWN"**  
- Bureau agents embedded in Soviet science teams flagged energy readings consistent with **Riftborn Static Field Bloom** 6 days prior to explosion  
- Almaz Echo tones detected **10 minutes** before the blast

## üß¨ ANOMALY SIGNALS PRIOR TO EXPLOSION

- **04.20.1986:** Numbers Fiend burst detected in 4171 kHz band ‚Äî encoded string included the names ‚ÄúLyudmila,‚Äù ‚ÄúPetrov,‚Äù ‚ÄúZero Hour‚Äù  
- **04.25.1986:** Pripyat observatory logs sudden drop in ambient radiation ‚Äì followed by inverse spike after 11:11 PM  
- **04.26.1986 ‚Äì 01:17 AM:** Electrical engineers hear **reverse Ukrainian whispers** through inactive headset channels



> ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have time to evacuate. It didn‚Äôt want to be evacuated.‚Äù  
> ‚Äì Anonymous Bureau asset, debriefed under amnestic protocol

## üíÄ THE BREACH

At **01:23:40**, the No. 4 reactor surges with unexplained static and harmonic resonance (matched by 1967 Rift Observatory collapse patterns).  



Then:
- Core melts.  
- Rift pulses through coolant tunnels.  
- Surveillance film distorts ‚Äî footage loops one second forward and one backward repeatedly.

Civilians later report:
- People "walking out of walls"  
- "Windows that showed things they never had before"  
- Ghostly reflections watching people *from the backs of their eyes*

## üßæ FIELD REPORT ‚Äì AGENT THATCHER (CLASSIFIED LOG 04/29/86)

> "Containment protocols failed within first hour. Reactor building exhibiting anomalous properties - walls appear to 'breathe' and show reflections of non-existent structures.

> Numbers Fiend broadcast confirmed accurate. Agent Petrov and Agent Lyudmila missing. Last transmission mentioned 'second city' visible through reactor walls.

> Mirrorwitch presence confirmed. Not echo - direct manifestation. Been here since before construction.

> This isn't containment breach. It's a remembering. Rift remembering what was here before we built on it.

> Equipment malfunctioning. Temporal artifacts detected. Will attempt final transmission if conditions permit.

> Agent Thatcher, signing off."

*Note: Agent Thatcher's full final transmission was received 7 years later. See classified file AT-FINAL-042986 for complete details.*

## üéß UKRAINIAN AUDIO RECORDINGS

### Plant Worker Emergency Log
> "It didn't melt down. It cracked *open*.  
> The heat was just the excuse ‚Äî the real fire came from whatever was behind that air.  
> I swear I saw a second city behind Pripyat for a second. Like it was being remembered too loudly."

## üîç BUREAU ACTIONS

### OPERATION: IRONSHELTER
- Enacted 04.27.1986, 18 hours post-incident  
- Goals:
  - Deploy memory scrubbing agents through "radiation exposure" cover
  - Secure Rift residuals beneath sarcophagus during later ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù
  - Remove Mirrorwitch echo fragments from VHS footage seized by Soviet TV stations

> Three Bureau agents embedded in Soviet response team were later declared **"temporally dislocated"** ‚Äî their bodies were recovered in 1993, unchanged.

<span style="color: transparent;">Agent Thatcher's final transmission was received seven years after he disappeared. The signal contained references to a "second city" and direct contact with the Numbers Fiend. Search for "AT-FINAL-042986" to access the classified transmission log.</span>

## üóùÔ∏è CLASSIFIED CONNECTIONS

| Thread | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **The Mirrorwitch** | Whispers from two-way glass in Pripyat hospital ‚Äî identical reverse-prediction phrases to 1974 Bureau event |
| **Almaz Echo** | Subharmonic signal detected 10 minutes prior to explosion, broadcast again on 2013 satellite ping |
| **Rift Observatory** | Reactor logs mimic ‚Äú3:11 AM‚Äù silence frequency spike from 1967 Antarctica incident |
| **Serum X-7** | One missing Soviet scientist (Dr. A. Vronsky) previously worked on biochemical Rift adaptation project under Project BLACKGATE |

## üîí SUPPRESSION STATUS

- Public: Radiation disaster with no mention of anomalous phenomena  
- Private: Zone cordoned for Rift bleed monitoring indefinitely  
- All "Stalker" incidents in Exclusion Zone since 1990 are under review as **Category 3 Temporal Feedback Events**

**END DOSSIER ‚Äì CHORNOBYL EVENT: "REACTOR FOUR"**  
*Field presence at Exclusion Zone active. Contact maintained with surviving Bureau agent M.B. under identity suppressor.*
