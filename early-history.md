## 📜 ERA OVERVIEW

Following the collapse of many ancient civilizations, there arose a period of global obfuscation — not merely historical, but ontological. This era is defined by records missing entire years, cities vanishing from maps, and outbreaks of phenomena that were dismissed as “folk tales” or “plague hysteria.”

In truth, this was the **Age of Erasure**.  
The Known Unknowns did not go dormant — they adapted.  
Where once they were worshipped, now they were hidden.  
Where once the Rift was raw, now it whispered through woodcuts, deathbed confessions, and disappearing towns.

## 📍 EVENT LOGS

### 🔹 1347 – *The Plague Ships and the Tongueless Seers*
- **Location:** Mediterranean, expanding into Europe  
- **Anomaly:** Alongside the Black Death, multiple instances of seers — often children or elderly — predicted outbreak vectors with exact detail.
- **Bureau Classification:** “Pattern Seers” // Early Unbound Manifestations  
- **Anomalous Behavior:**  
  - All afflicted oracles had **no tongues**, yet could speak briefly in perfect Latin, Sumerian, or unknown glossolalia.  
  - Final words recorded in at least one case: *“The world coughs when the Rift breathes.”*

> NOTE: Some plague doctors’ masks recovered show **Riftborn sigils etched inside**, possibly used to block memetic contamination.

### 🔹 1583 – *The Roanoke Displacement*
- **Location:** Roanoke Colony, North Carolina  
- **Public Outcome:** Colony vanished. Only the word “CROATOAN” remained.  
- **Bureau Investigation (Retcon Series 2-A):**  
  - Saliva samples from preserved wood trace to **Doorlicker** (cryptid-class parasite).  
  - One tent stake found embedded in the ground upside-down, *as if pulled inward*.  
  - Time distortion ring suggests **localized rift collapse**.

- **Suppression Method:** Story reframed as “unsolved mystery.” Lost Kin cultists executed under the guise of “witch trials.”

### 🔹 1645 – *The Mirrorless Execution*
- **Location:** Würzburg, Germany  
- **Event Type:** Visual Anomaly Outbreak during witch purge  
- **Phenomenon:** 17 individuals burned at the stake for “hollow reflections.” Eyewitnesses claimed they cast shadows but no mirror image — a behavior linked to the **Mirrorwitch** entity.
- **Bureau Report:** Mirrorwitch manifestation predates known records. Presence likely triggered by mass ritual trauma.

### 🔹 1790 – *Franklin’s Ice Journal*
- **Location:** Canadian Arctic (Franklin Expedition)  
- **Object:** Journal Entry #144, confiscated by OATH operatives (precursor to Bureau)  
- **Entry Fragment:**  
  > *“A voice beneath the ice offered a trade. I did not answer. But the ice remembered.”*

- **Riftborn Connection:** Post-incident, 7 crew members developed identical dreams of being buried alive in reverse. The ship’s wreckage later found with scratch marks *on the ceiling* of a submerged corridor.

## 🧾 CONCLUDING ANALYSIS

- The period between 1100 and 1850 represents a global shift in anomaly strategy.  
- Entities no longer dominated openly — instead, they exploited:
  - Cultural blind spots
  - Religious hysteria
  - The collapse of oral traditions
