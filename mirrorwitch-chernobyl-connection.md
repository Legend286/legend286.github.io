**Classification Level:** EYES ONLY // SPECTRAL DIVISION  
**Access Restriction:** Steganographic Discovery Protocol  
**File Designation:** UNB-06-CH86-MIRROR  
**Cross-Reference:** EVT-CH86-BUREACTOR, UNB-06 Entity Dossier  
**Discovery Method:** Embedded Audio Analysis - "–¢–´ –í –ó–ï–†–ö–ê–õ–ï"

## ü™û OVERVIEW

The entity designated **UNB-06 "The Mirrorwitch"** was not merely a witness to the Chernobyl incident ‚Äì **she was the catalyst**.

Recent analysis of steganographic insertions in recovered audio logs reveals the Mirrorwitch's **direct temporal manipulation** of the reactor breach timeline, suggesting the disaster was an orchestrated attempt to create a **permanent reflection gateway** between dimensions.

## üîç HIDDEN CONNECTIONS

### Pre-Incident Activity
- **April 20, 1986:** Pripyat hospital staff report mirrors showing "wrong reflections" - patients' faces appearing as strangers
- **April 23, 1986:** Bureau Agent Volkov's surveillance notes: *"Subject seen entering reactor control room through reflective surface of CRT monitor"*
- **April 25, 1986:** Control room cameras malfunction - footage shows operators making decisions **in reverse chronological order**

### The Mirror Protocol
Analysis of steganographic audio reveals the Mirrorwitch's whispered incantations embedded beneath reactor communications:

> **"–¢–´ –í –ó–ï–†–ö–ê–õ–ï... –¢–´ –í –ó–ï–†–ö–ê–õ–ï... TIME FLOWS BACKWARD THROUGH GLASS..."**

Translation suggests she was attempting to **reverse-engineer causality** - making the reactor explosion happen because it was reflected to have already happened.

## üåÄ TEMPORAL MECHANICS

The Mirrorwitch's reverse precognition allowed her to:
1. **See the explosion's reflection** before it occurred
2. **Manipulate operators** through reflective surfaces to cause the conditions she had foreseen
3. **Create a causal loop** where the disaster became inevitable because she had already witnessed its reflection

### Evidence of Manipulation:
- Reactor operators report seeing "future selves" in monitor screens giving contrary instructions
- Security cameras recorded the same 3-minute sequence playing forward and backward simultaneously
- **Key insight:** The explosion wasn't prevented because the Mirrorwitch was **reflecting the future into the present**

## üî¨ BUREAU ANALYSIS

**Dr. Helena Marsh, Temporal Anomalies Division:**
> *"She didn't predict the disaster - she created it by showing people their reflections in a world where it had already happened. Classic retrocausal manipulation through mirrored surfaces."*

**Agent Petrov's Final Log (04/26/86 - 01:22 AM):**
> *"I can see myself in the glass, but I'm older, and I'm screaming. The reflection is one minute ahead of real time. It's trying to warn me, but the witch... she's making us watch our own futures burn."*

## üö® POST-INCIDENT MANIFESTATIONS

Following the breach, Bureau agents documented:
- **Reflection lag** in mirrors throughout the Exclusion Zone - reflections appearing 3-7 seconds behind reality
- Photographs of the disaster site showing **two different explosions** in reflective surfaces
- **Personnel reports:** Seeing themselves in mirrors wearing hazmat suits before being issued protective equipment

### Current Status:
The Mirrorwitch remains **anchored to the site** through the massive reflective pool created by the reactor's melted core. Satellite thermal imaging occasionally detects her presence as a **temperature-reversed signature** - heat appearing as cold, shadows appearing as light.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OPERATIONAL NOTES

**Warning to Personnel:**
- **DO NOT** bring mirrors, phones, or reflective equipment into Zone of Exclusion
- If you see your reflection acting independently, immediately report to Temporal Division
- **Never make eye contact** with your reflection while within 30km of reactor site

**Standing Order 086-M:**
*Any mirror-related anomalies in reactor footage are to be classified under the Mirrorwitch Addendum and routed directly to Spectral Division for temporal analysis.*
