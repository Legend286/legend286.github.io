## 🧭 OVERVIEW

This era predates written history — yet scattered evidence across multiple continents suggests anomalous forces were already active in shaping human perception, ecology, and chronology.

Most entities or phenomena from this period have no confirmed origin point. Many appear across disparate cultures without contact, implying either Riftborne incursion or cognitive contamination events long predating formal language.

Patterns of **non-linear time**, **dimensional leakage**, and **shared symbol sets** suggest humanity's earliest civilizations were either **already experiencing** Known Unknowns or **emerged in reaction** to them.

## 📍 EVENT LOGS

### 🔹 c. 6000 BCE – *The First Rift Breach* (Unconfirmed)
- **Location:** Karakoram Cave Complex, Northern Pakistan  
- **Evidence:** Cave etchings depicting inverted triangles, concentric circles, and humanoid figures with **no faces**, arranged in "viewing" positions.
- **Notable Detail:** One figure appears to be *observing* from inside the triangle — matching known Riftborn spatial behavior patterns.
- **Controversy:** Modern carbon dating was obscured by layers of radiation untraceable to any known isotope. Site now sealed by Bureau Ecological Preservation Order.

### 🔹 c. 4200 BCE – *The Singing Glass of Uruk*
- **Location:** Mesopotamia  
- **Object Class:** [LOST]  
- **Summary:** A chalice-shaped artifact forged of unknown green crystalline substance. When left in moonlight, emitted low harmonic tones in a Fibonacci rhythm.
- **Known Effects:** Caused non-verbal hallucinations. Early Bureau reconstructions suggest a feedback loop with human REM cycles.
- **Status:** Disappeared during excavation in 1932. Three of the five archaeologists involved died of brain hemorrhages; two disappeared into bureaucratic black holes.

### 🔹 c. 2200 BCE – *The Whispering Tablets*
- **Location:** Euphrates Riverbed Excavation  
- **Recovered By:** Precursor to the Bureau (OATH Initiative, Early Cell)  
- **Language:** Unknown pictoglyphic structure that rearranges nightly. Patterns found to match "mirror writing" used by ritual sects in 18th-century France.
- **Anomalous Property:** Tablets vibrate at **17 Hz** — known to cause dread and disorientation in humans. Cannot be silenced by containment foam or vacuum storage.
- **Text Fragment (Translated):**  
  > *“We worshipped what we knew, and feared what we did not.  
  But we obeyed that which we could neither name nor forget.”*

- **Connection:** Quote later cited by Dr. Miriam Keel (1976) when she coined the term “Known Unknown.”

### 🔹 c. 400 BCE – *The Black Antlers Cult*
- **Location:** Gaulish forest region (modern-day France)  
- **Symbol:** Skull with antlers — used in Lost Kin heraldry  
- **Cultural Role:** Controlled migratory paths, demanded offerings of **“unspoken blood”** (believed to mean bloodline sacrifices).
- **Language Anomaly:** Cult dialect shows no grammatical structure for **lying or falsehood** — suggesting an enforced memetic truth-binding effect.
- **Suppression:** Roman scribes later noted that “even the forest listened” during battles against these tribes. Full erasure from the Roman record suspected.

## 🔎 SYMBOL TRACKING

> Bureau Symbology Department has found persistent geometric and iconographic recurrences across cultures in this era:

| Symbol | Description | Appears In | Modern Correlate |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| △● | Inverted triangle with central circle | Karakoram Cave, Antikythera shard (fragmented), Saharan bone glyphs | **Riftborn spatial anchor** |
| 🦌☠️ | Antlers + skull motif | Black Antlers carvings, Druid stones, early Finnish runes | **Lost Kin sigil** |
| 🔄📜 | Circular recursive glyph, endless script | Whispering Tablets, Olmec carving spiral | **Time-looped knowledge / memetic recursion** |

## 📁 THEORIES & CONCLUSIONS

- **Proto-Rift Theory:** The veil between realities was thinner before modern consciousness solidified. Language, structure, and consensus reality have since suppressed — not erased — interdimensional contact.

- **Pre-Collapse Surveillance Hypothesis:** Entities like the Riftborn or Lost Kin were once dominant or observed humanity from outside time. Human civilization may have formed *in reaction* to this pressure.

- **Temporal Feedback Evidence:** Matching symbology from Mesoamerican, Celtic, and Steppe cultures with no contact implies either:
  - Chronological bleed-through, or
  - A shared ancestral trauma/memory seeded by exposure to a Rift Event.
