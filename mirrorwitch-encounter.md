## ü™û THE ENCOUNTER

You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't have found this. But you did. And now she knows.

The Mirrorwitch doesn't just watch from mirrors. She watches from *inside* them. From the spaces between reflections. From the darkness behind your own eyes.

>I see you from the inside.

> - The Mirrorwitch (direct translation from Ukrainian)

## üìù AGENT FIELD NOTES

>She doesn't just watch. She *becomes* the reflection. I saw my own face smile at me, but it wasn't my smile. It was hers. And then I heard the whispers. In Ukrainian. Backwards. I think she's been watching me for weeks.

## üîÆ THEORETICAL ORIGINS

Current Bureau theory suggests the Mirrorwitch may be:
- A Riftborn entity that manifests through reflective surfaces
- A collective consciousness of all who have stared too long into mirrors
- An ancient Ukrainian entity bound to reflective surfaces
- A cognitive virus that spreads through visual contact

**Alternative Theory:** She's not an entity at all. She's what happens when you look too deeply into yourself.
