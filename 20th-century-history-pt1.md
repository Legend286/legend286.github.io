## üìú ERA OVERVIEW

This era marks a pivotal threshold in global anomalous activity: the tipping point where the Known Unknowns began interacting with industrialized society.

Unlike earlier eras of hidden folklore and suppressed memory, this period shows clear patterns of:
- **Technological interference**
- **Temporal overlap**
- **Structured entity response**

Anomalies no longer haunt only the forest and the forgotten. Now, they whisper through wires, flicker in static, and echo from towers.

## üìç EVENT LOGS

### üîπ 1902 ‚Äì *Tesla‚Äôs Signal Tower Anomaly*
- **Location:** Colorado Springs Lab  
- **Anomaly:** During his wireless energy experiments, Nikola Tesla records an unexplained return signal from outside Earth‚Äôs magnetic field.
- **Log Entry (Recovered):**  
  > ‚ÄúIt replied before I finished. It knew the shape of what I would say.‚Äù

- **Object Evidence:** A blueprint sketch of a receiver includes **inverted geometry** mathematically impossible to render in 3D space.
- **Bureau Response:** Early OATH operatives seize notes. Some diagrams later appear encoded in *Numbers Fiend* transmissions.

---

### üîπ 1916 ‚Äì *The Verdun Echo*
- **Location:** Verdun, France  
- **Phenomenon:** During a lull in shelling, dozens of Allied and German soldiers report hearing whispers in the mud ‚Äî voices **predicting their deaths** with precise timestamps.
- **Mortality Correlation:** 89% of names heard died within the week.
- **Known Entity Involvement:** Suspected *Riftborn Echo Class* residual effect, amplified by extreme trauma.
- **Suppression Strategy:** Official reports altered. Survivors reassigned to asylum units. Echo transcripts erased from French archives.

### üîπ 1928 ‚Äì *The Dreams of Aleksei Mirov*
- **Location:** Yekaterinburg, USSR  
- **Subject:** Aleksei Mirov, blind from birth, began drawing complex sigil patterns in ash after sleepwalking episodes.
- **Anomalous Detail:** All sigils matched carvings from **Karakoram Cave (6000 BCE)**.
- **Dream Transcript (Translated):**  
  > ‚ÄúThey showed me the end. Not of the world ‚Äî but of its shape.‚Äù

- **Entity Class:** Precursor Riftborn // possibly **non-temporal observer**
- **Outcome:** Subject vanished during Bureau transport. Chalk drawing of an eye remained in holding cell, blinking for 7 minutes post-contact.

### üîπ 1938 ‚Äì *The Founding of the Bureau (OATH Reformed)*
- **Event Type:** Structural Reorganization  
- **Context:** Rise of anomalous incidents during interwar period prompts transformation of OATH into the full Bureau entity.

- **First Mandate:**  
  - Suppress post-industrial anomalous outbreaks.  
  - Prevent memetic leakage via public technologies.  
  - Archive and compartmentalize Rift-related phenomena.

- **Founding Personnel:** Included defectors from British psychic warfare divisions and remnants of American "hollow Earth" researchers.
- **Symbol Adopted:** Three redaction bars over an open file folder. Interpreted internally as: *Know. Deny. Forget.*

---

### üîπ 1943 ‚Äì *The Atlantic Fog Convoy*
- **Location:** North Atlantic shipping lane  
- **Phenomenon:** Four Allied ships vanish in formation during thick fog. Radio contact recorded final phrase from Captain Varne:  
  > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the sea, it‚Äôs the mouth.‚Äù

- **Wreckage:** Recovered lifeboats intact. All compasses spun **toward the center of the fog**.
- **Post-Event Outcome:**  
  - New entity designated: **Ossaconda-class Rift Entity**  
  - Fog recurrence logged near Bermuda and Icelandic trenchline.
  - Event linked to subsea ‚Äúmagneto-chatter‚Äù ‚Äî same frequency as Tesla tower return (1902).

## üß¨ PATTERN RECOGNITION

| Phenomenon              | First Appearance | Recurred in        | Notes                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Inverted Geometry       | 1902             | 1983, 2025         | Matches Riftborn spatial distortion   |
| Echo Whispers           | 1916             | 1983, 2013         | Often precede timeline shifts         |
| Memetic Sigils          | 1928             | 1347, 2021         | Dream-induced; often cross-temporal   |
| Vanishing Convoys       | 1943             | 1978 (Almaz), 1999 | Always involve electromagnetic spikes |

> ‚ÄúWith war comes chaos. With chaos, cracks.  
> The Rift watches our noise the way we watch signal flares in the dark.  
> We made too much noise in this era.  
> They began to notice.‚Äù
