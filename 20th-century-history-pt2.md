## 🧿 ERA OVERVIEW

This era represents the Bureau's most **aggressively interventionist period**. The post-WWII global restructuring enabled black-budget alliances, decommissioned war programs, and psychological operations — many of which were reabsorbed into the Bureau's expanding infrastructure.

For the first time in modern history, the anomalies were no longer just **observed** or **feared**.  
They were **weaponized**, **experimented upon**, and above all — **covered up**.

The era is defined by:
- Shadow cold wars over anomalous assets
- Large-scale information suppression
- The birth of amnestics, containment protocols, and cryptid disinformation campaigns

## 📍 EVENT LOGS

### 🔹 1947 – *Bureau Formation (Global Directive 3-S)*
- **Context:** Remnants of wartime intelligence initiatives (MI-666, OSS Paranormal Analysis Group, Soviet Division Я-0) merged under covert U.N. authority.
- **Stated Purpose (External):** Contain weaponizable psychic or anomalous tech.
- **True Mandate (Internal):**  
  - Manage dimensional bleed  
  - Neutralize high-threat Riftborn presences  
  - Suppress any public anomaly records beyond local folklore levels

- **Symbol Finalized:** Three redaction bars over a file folder — interpreted: *“Know. Deny. Forget.”*

---

### 🔹 1959 – *The Numbers Fiend Broadcast Begins*
- **Location:** Shortwave radio spectrum, global band interference  
- **Phenomenon:** Repeating strings of digits, tones, and names began transmission from untraceable origins.
- **Behavior:** Each broadcast contained a name and a countdown. Upon reaching zero, the individual listed died within hours — often via heart attack, suicide, or unexplained accident.

- **Anomalous Correlation:**  
  - Many deaths politically sensitive  
  - Code signatures show modulation pattern matching **Tesla Return Signal (1902)**  
  - Identical tones later found in **Almaz Echo (1978)**

- **Containment:** Bureau begins “Receiver Scramble” initiative — mass production of faulty ham radios and licensed jamming hardware under Cold War patents.

---

### 🔹 1967 – *The Static Incident at Rift Observatory*
- **Location:** Antarctica – Bureau Rift Observatory 04-A  
- **Event:** Station recorded **3 minutes of modulated silence** across all monitoring bands. During those minutes:
  - 17 Bureau agents worldwide committed suicide simultaneously  
  - Multiple black site computers melted from the inside  
  - Static tone embedded a phrase only visible via CRT distortion:  
    > “You are inside the broadcast now.”

- **Outcome:**  
  - Facility abandoned  
  - All footage degraded  
  - Only remaining record is a **tape recorder that hums when exposed to starlight**

---

### 🔹 1973 – *REDSKY Protocol Triggered (Redwood Deep)*
- **Trigger:** Agent Dawes records “a tree screamed in my voice” before collapsing.
- **Entity Involvement:** **Birchskin**, a predatory mimic, confirmed active.
- **Anomaly:** One tent canvas was 30 years older than its manufacture date.
- **Protocol Outcome:**  
  - Zone permanently delisted  
  - Redwood Deep marked as Tier III ecological hazard  
  - Local legends encouraged to prevent further visitation

---

### 🔹 1983 – *First Confirmed Riftborn Contact – "The Folding Man"*
- **Location:** South Haven, Michigan  
- **Cover Story:** Chemical plant explosion  
- **Entity Description:** Visual distortion class. Appears as **a humanoid bent through itself** — joints and angles that should not exist in Euclidean space.

- **Aftermath:**  
  - 62 civilian casualties  
  - Bureau enacts first wide-area memory erasure protocol  
  - Entity not destroyed — later traced to static fields at Rift Observatory
