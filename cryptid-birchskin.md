## üß¨ PHENOTYPE DESCRIPTION

- **Apparent Structure:** Humanoid, approximately 2.4m tall when fully extended from bark camouflage.  
- **Biological Integration:** Entity seamlessly merges with forest topology, appearing as natural birch tree formations until activation.  
- **Dermal Characteristics:** Skin exhibits bark-like texture with natural birch coloration and markings. Peeling occurs in organic sheets, revealing darker substrate beneath.

- **Locomotion:** Moves through root network systems underground. Surface manifestation appears instantaneous, emerging from existing tree trunks.  
- **Organic Signature:** Infrared detection shows no heat signature when camouflaged. Upon activation, temperature spikes to 40¬∞C at extremities.

## üì° OBSERVED ABILITIES

- **Perfect Camouflage:** Complete visual integration with birch forest environment. Undetectable until movement or vocalization occurs.  
- **Voice Mimicry:** Replicates speech patterns of victims and lost loved ones with perfect acoustic fidelity. Can reproduce conversations from memory.  
- **Biomass Integration:** Consumes organic matter through direct contact, incorporating tissue into own trunk system for nutrition and growth.  
- **Forest Manipulation:** Demonstrated ability to rapidly regrow damaged vegetation and alter local tree positioning during encounters.

## üìç NOTABLE INCIDENTS

### üå≤ REDSKY Protocol Contact ‚Äì 1973  
- **Operation Status:** Terminated  
- **Casualties:** Team Alpha (5 personnel) presumed consumed  
- **Primary Contact:** Agent Dawes reported entity mimicking his own voice before communication ceased  
- **Environmental Effects:** Photonic inversion field, temporal audio displacement, organic looping phenomena  
- **Recovery Status:** No remains recovered. Camera equipment found integrated into bark structure.

### üåø Civilian Disappearances ‚Äì 1963-1972  
- **Pattern Analysis:** 23 missing persons in Redwood Deep vicinity  
- **Common Factors:** All victims last heard calling out familiar names  
- **Witness Reports:** Local accounts of "trees calling children's names"  
- **Suppression Strategy:** "Forest That Hunts Back" urban legend seeded in regional folklore

## üßæ AGENT REPORT EXCERPT (FIELD LOG 1973)

> "The birch grove looked normal at 0600 hours.  
> At 0647, Dawes called out his daughter's name.  
> That's when we realized the trees had been watching us the entire time.  
> They weren't trees. They were *waiting.*  
> The bark doesn't grow inward ‚Äî it grows *around* things."

‚Äì Agent Lark, REDSKY Support Team (Recovered Journal, 1983)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONTAINMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Status:** Geographically contained within Redwood Deep perimeter  
- **Perimeter Protocol:** 2.4km exclusion zone maintained under forestry service cover  
- **Engagement Rules:**  
  - NO verbal communication within zone perimeter  
  - Audio monitoring only via sealed remote systems  
  - Emergency burn protocols ineffective (entity demonstrates fire resistance)

- **Suppression Methods:**  
  - Continuous seismic monitoring for root network activity  
  - Infrared aerial surveillance every 72 hours  
  - Local folklore maintenance program to deter civilian entry

## üî∫ NOTES FROM THE ARCHIVE

> "Birchskin doesn't hunt. It *harvests.*  
> The missing persons aren't victims ‚Äî they're ingredients.  
> Every tree in that grove has a name it shouldn't know."

‚Äì Dr. Helena Cross, Xenobiology Research Division

> "We thought we were tracking one entity.  
> Forest floor analysis suggests we're dealing with a distributed organism.  
> Birchskin isn't a creature living in the forest ‚Äî it *is* the forest."
