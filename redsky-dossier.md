# OPERATION DOSSIER ‚Äì REDSKY PROTOCOL

**Operation Designation:** REDSKY  
**Status:** TERMINATED  
**Protocol Type:** Live-Containment Response / Entity Escalation  
**Initiated:** May 14, 1973  
**Location:** Redwood Deep, Pacific Northwest (Coord. Withheld)  
**Compiled by:** Bureau Field Incident Command // Archive Reference Node: OP-RSKY-73

## üå≤ OVERVIEW

**REDSKY** was a Bureau containment action initiated after a series of abnormal disappearances and audio anomalies in the Redwood Deep zone reached critical mass. The protocol was designed as a limited incursion and threat neutralization against what was then classified as ‚ÄúPredatory Lurker Entity A‚Äù ‚Äî later identified as **Birchskin**.

REDSKY marks the **first formal use of autonomous containment units** within an unstable temporal loop zone. It is also the first operation to trigger **psychomimetic contagion spread across personnel memory**.

## üö® INCIDENT TIMELINE

### üìÖ May 14, 1973 ‚Äî 06:13
- Agent Dawes logs auditory anomaly: **‚Äúchildren laughing‚Äù** during routine drone calibration.
- Team Alpha enters Zone 2 perimeter.
- Visual distortion logged on analog cameras ‚Äî light bend consistent with Rift field fluctuation.

---

### üìÖ May 14, 1973 ‚Äî 07:44
- Agent Dawes activates bodycam, stating:
  > *‚ÄúI think the trees are getting closer.‚Äù*

- Comm logs confirm tree line **visibly shifting** between frames.
- Audio sample records phrase:
  > ‚ÄúWhy did you cut me?‚Äù

- Three seconds later, all cameras fail simultaneously.

---

### üìÖ May 14, 1973 ‚Äî 07:47
- Agent Dawes transmits final known statement:
  > *‚ÄúA tree just screamed using my voice.‚Äù*

- Heart rate spikes to 214 BPM, then flatlines.  
- Body never recovered ‚Äî camera discovered nailed into tree bark, lens facing **inward**.

## üß¨ ENTITY ENGAGEMENT REPORT

- **Target Identified:** Cryptid-Class Entity // BIRCHSKIN  
- **Observed Capabilities:**  
  - Camouflage against forest topology  
  - Mimicry of lost loved ones and victims‚Äô own voices  
  - Consumption of organic matter; integrates body mass into trunk systems

- **Zone Feedback Effects:**  
  - **Photonic Inversion:** Flashlights cast light *away* from bearer  
  - **Temporal Drift:** Agents reported hearing orders **before they were issued**  
  - **Organic Looping:** Trees cut during operation regrew instantly with different bark signatures

## üì¶ AFTERMATH & SUPPRESSION

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Team Alpha | All presumed deceased (no remains recovered) |
| Agent Dawes | MIA ‚Äì declared KIA. Mindprint echoes detected in later REDWOOD audio logs |
| Drone Footage | Unusable ‚Äì camera feeds record *the same 4 seconds on loop*, from different angles |
| Civilian Suppression | ‚ÄúForest That Hunts Back‚Äù urban legend seeded in local press |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROTOCOL FAILURE NOTES

- Incursion protocols not designed for **dreaming forest terrain**  
- Emergency burn attempts failed ‚Äî trees **refused ignition**, even with Bureau-grade accelerant  
- Redwood Deep now designated a **Tier III Ecological Anomaly Zone**

> All REDSKY documentation was sealed. Reopened in 1999 under OPERATION: CHILDGLASS.

## üßæ FIELD JOURNAL EXCERPT ‚Äì AGENT LARK (RECOVERED 1983)

> ‚ÄúThe forest doesn‚Äôt sleep. It dreams.  
> That‚Äôs worse.  
> Something in there is *thinking* in bark and bone, and it doesn‚Äôt care what we call it.  
> We named it Birchskin, but it already had a name ‚Äî it just won‚Äôt say it out loud.‚Äù

## üîí CURRENT STATUS

- Redwood Deep remains active under Bureau watch  
- REDSKY has become a template case for **anti-entity engagement in self-modifying terrain**  
- All former REDSKY personnel considered **psychologically contaminated posthumously**  
- Any references to ‚Äúscreaming trees‚Äù in Bureau logs are automatically cross-indexed with this file
