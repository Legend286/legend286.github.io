## ü™û ENTITY DESCRIPTION

**The Mirrorwitch** is a spectral manifestation tied to **reflective surfaces**, especially those within emotionally or psychically charged environments (interrogation rooms, trauma sites, abandoned bedrooms).  

She is not always visible ‚Äî but her *presence* is detectable via:
- Peripheral distortion (described as ‚Äúhair in the eye‚Äù flickers)  
- Shadow doubling  
- Reverse whispering (auditory hallucinations played backward)

> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see her. You see what she wants you to think she might look like.‚Äù  
> ‚Äì Agent Hall, Post-Incident Log #0049

## üß¨ ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOR

| Phenomenon | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Prediction in Reverse** | Whispered phrases play backward, but when reversed, describe future events with uncanny specificity. Accuracy: 91%. |
| **Reflection Corruption** | Mirrors touched by entity reflect moments *not from this timeline*. Some show childhood bedrooms of deceased agents. |
| **Interrogation Looping** | Victims exposed during questioning sessions report having been ‚Äúasked questions she hadn‚Äôt heard yet.‚Äù Footage confirms echoing, time-skipped responses. |
| **Memory Bleed** | Victims begin remembering ‚Äúmemories from her life‚Äù ‚Äî no confirmed source or identity exists for entity. |

## üìç FIRST APPEARANCE ‚Äì 1974

### Location: Bureau Interrogation Site B-3 (Basement Level)  
- Room contained a **two-way mirror**, behind which audio anomalies began in the middle of a standard interview.
- Mirror fogged without temperature change.  
- Subject (Agent Calden) collapsed, bleeding from the ears, repeating the phrase:  
  > *‚ÄúShe showed me when I die, and then I remembered how it felt.‚Äù*

### Recovered Tape (Partially Redacted):
> ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù  
> *(silence)*  
> ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù  
> *(distorted female whisper, reversed):*  
> ‚Äú...the child you left in the dark.‚Äù

## üß™ ENTITY CLASSIFICATION

- **Entity Class:** Unbound  
- **Subtype:** Haunter // Mirrorbound Recursive  
- **Origin Theory:** Residual emotional trauma cluster given memetic feedback by Rift proximity or serum-induced perception expansion  
- **Hostility Index:** Passive-Recursive (will not pursue but will reappear when remembered)

> Exposure risk increases when name is **spoken aloud while in proximity to glass, screens, or water**.

## üîÆ SYMBOLOGY APPEARANCE

- **Known Symbol:** Cracked mirror with stitched edge  
- Found scrawled in soot on 19th-century orphanage wall (unrelated to Bureau ops)  
- Appears in ritual binding books and early cultic dream journals, always under the label: *‚ÄúThe Other She.‚Äù*

## üì¶ CONTAINMENT STRATEGY

- No known permanent containment. Entity tied to **conceptual reflection**, not just physical mirrors.  
- All Bureau reflective surfaces coated with matte anti-glare resin or one-way memory filters.  
- Mirrorwitch-infected locations are marked with **WITCHGLASS** tape and removed from service.

### ‚úò DO NOT:
- Speak to your reflection if you hear it speak first  
- Answer questions posed in reversed speech  
- Investigate fogged glass in secured areas

## üîé INTERSECTIONS

| Case / Object | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| **Serum X-7** | Subjects under serum exposure more likely to ‚Äúsee her in polished metal‚Äù |
| **Numbers Fiend** | Reverse whispers match pitch of Name Stream bursts |
| **Black Site 11** | Reappears in footage loops ‚Äî despite no mirrors being present in footage |
| **Ragthrum Case (1996)** | Child‚Äôs reflection observed moving independently from subject; same whisper pattern noted |

## üßæ ARCHIVIST NOTE

> ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not a ghost. She‚Äôs a question that hasn‚Äôt been asked yet.  
> And the moment you look into the mirror ‚Äî she decides whether *you‚Äôre the one meant to ask it.*‚Äù

‚Äì Archivist M. LeFevre, Psychomemetic Residual Brief
