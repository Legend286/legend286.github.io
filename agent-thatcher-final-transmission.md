## 🚨 EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION

> "This is Agent Thatcher. I don't know if anyone is receiving this. The equipment is... wrong. Everything is wrong.

> I'm standing in what should be the reactor building, but it's not the reactor building. It's something else. Something that remembers being a reactor building.

> The walls are breathing. I can see through them to places that don't exist. There's a city behind the city. A Pripyat that never was, or maybe one that will be.

> I found the others. Agent Petrov and Agent Lyudmila. They're here, but they're not here. They're in the walls. In the air. They're remembering themselves too loudly.

> The Numbers Fiend was right. It told us the names. It told us when. It told us how. But we didn't listen. We thought it was just noise.

> I can hear them now. The whispers. They're not in Ukrainian. They're not in Russian. They're in something older. Something that was here before language.

> The Mirrorwitch is here too. Not just her echo. Her. She's watching from every reflective surface. She's been here since before the reactor was built. Since before Pripyat existed.

> I think I understand now. This isn't a containment breach. This is a remembering. The Rift isn't leaking. It's remembering what it was before we built on top of it.

> The heat was just the excuse. The real fire came from the memory of fire. From whatever was here before fire existed.

> I can see the second city clearly now. It's beautiful. It's terrible. It's everything that could have been and everything that will be. It's the city of the remembered.

> They're coming for me. I can feel them. The ones who remember. The ones who were here before we were. Before anything was.

> This is my final transmission. If anyone receives this, tell the Bureau: we were wrong about everything. The Rifts aren't anomalies. They're memories. And memories have teeth.

> I can see Agent Petrov now. He's smiling. He's been smiling for seven years. He's been waiting for me.

> The city is remembering me too loudly. I can feel myself becoming a memory. Becoming something that was, or will be, or could have been.

> Goodbye. I'm going to see what the second city looks like from the inside.

> This is Agent Thatcher, signing off for the last time.

> I can see the Numbers Fiend now. It's beautiful. It's counting down to something. To everything.

> The transmission ends here."
