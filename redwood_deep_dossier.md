**SITE DOSSIER: REDWOOD DEEP**

**Location:** Pacific Northwest (Exact coordinates withheld)
**Designation:** Anomalous Ecological Zone // Threat Tier: III // Ongoing Containment Priority: HIGH
**Compiled by:** Bureau Ecological Intelligence Subdivision // File 0024

### Overview

Redwood Deep is a forested expanse estimated at 61 square kilometers. While originally part of a publicly documented national park, the Bureau officially delisted the area in 1968 following the third disappearance cluster and subsequent field agent casualties.

Satellite mapping shows no irregularity in terrain. However, manned entry teams report inconsistent topology, visual distortions, time loss, and auditory hallucinations. Several flora species have no known biological relatives.

### Anomalous Activity Index

- **Temporal Looping:** Subjects report repeating forest paths despite continuous forward travel.
- **Spontaneous Flora Regrowth:** Felled trees regrow within hours. Cut vines bleed a dark red sap.
- **Audio Phenomena:** Children laughing, often used by Birchskin as lures. Static whispers in languages yet to be deciphered.
- **Photonic Inversion:** Flashlight beams invert — illuminating outward instead of inward.

### Known Entities

#### Birchskin
- Classification: Cryptid-Class Entity // Predatory Lurker
- Description: Camouflaged humanoid composed of bark, moss, and bone.
- Ability: Mimics sounds of lost loved ones. Absorbs organic matter to grow in size.

#### Doorlicker
- Classification: Parasitic Haunter
- Description: Pale, long-limbed figure with oversized tongue. Enters dwellings via unlocked entrances.
- Notable Behavior: Leaves behind saliva traces with mutagenic properties.

#### Hollow Watcher (Occasional Manifestation)
- Classification: Riftborn Echo
- Description: Appears in doorways during electrical disruption events. Faceless, tall, emits static fields.

### Historical Incidents

- **1967: The Pearson Scouts Vanishing**
  - 12 high school scouts disappeared overnight. One tent remained — its canvas aged 30 years beyond manufacture.

- **1973: REDSKY Protocol Triggered**
  - Agent First Class Dawes witnessed "a tree scream like a human" before collapsing. Footage degrades on playback.

- **1999: Operation CHILDGLASS**
  - Attempted controlled burn resulted in burn radius collapse. Fireproof material combusted.

---

### Suppression Strategy

- Rerouted major hiking trails.
- Local legends encouraged to discourage visitation (e.g., “The Forest That Hunts Back”).
- Drone surveillance re-established in 2023 using inverted lens optics.
