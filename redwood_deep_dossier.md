**Classification:** Anomalous Ecological Zone // High Distortion Class  
**Threat Tier:** III (Ongoing Containment Priority: HIGH)  
**Location:** Pacific Northwest (Exact coordinates withheld)  
**Status:** Uncontained // Perimeter Monitored  
**Date Established:** 1968 (Official Delisting)  
**Compiled by:** Bureau Ecological Intelligence Subdivision  
**File ID:** AEZ-24-1968-REDWOOD

**→ Related Timeline:** See Era IV timeline for REDSKY Protocol activation (1973).

## 📍 OVERVIEW

Redwood Deep is a forested expanse estimated at 61 square kilometers. While originally part of a publicly documented national park, the Bureau officially delisted the area in 1968 following the third disappearance cluster and subsequent field agent casualties.

Satellite mapping shows no irregularity in terrain. However, manned entry teams report inconsistent topology, visual distortions, time loss, and auditory hallucinations. Several flora species have no known biological relatives.

## ⚡ ANOMALOUS ACTIVITY INDEX

- **Temporal Looping:** Subjects report repeating forest paths despite continuous forward travel
- **Spontaneous Flora Regrowth:** Felled trees regrow within hours. Cut vines bleed a dark red sap
- **Audio Phenomena:** Children laughing, often used by Birchskin as lures. Static whispers in languages yet to be deciphered
- **Photonic Inversion:** Flashlight beams invert — illuminating outward instead of inward

## 🧬 KNOWN ENTITIES

### Birchskin
- **Classification:** Cryptid-Class Entity // Predatory Lurker
- **Description:** Camouflaged humanoid composed of bark, moss, and bone
- **Ability:** Mimics sounds of lost loved ones. Absorbs organic matter to grow in size

### Doorlicker
- **Classification:** Parasitic Haunter
- **Description:** Pale, long-limbed figure with oversized tongue. Enters dwellings via unlocked entrances
- **Notable Behavior:** Leaves behind saliva traces with mutagenic properties

### Hollow Watcher (Occasional Manifestation)
- **Classification:** Riftborn Echo
- **Description:** Appears in doorways during electrical disruption events. Faceless, tall, emits static fields

## 📍 NOTABLE INCIDENTS

### 🧷 The Pearson Scouts Vanishing – 1967
- **Cover Story:** Severe weather incident
- **Casualties:** 12 high school scouts disappeared overnight
- **Evidence:** One tent remained — its canvas aged 30 years beyond manufacture

### 🔥 REDSKY Protocol Triggered – 1973
- **Event:** Agent First Class Dawes witnessed "a tree scream like a human" before collapsing
- **Evidence:** Footage degrades on playback
- **Result:** Triggered first REDSKY containment protocol

### 💀 Operation CHILDGLASS – 1999
- **Objective:** Attempted controlled burn
- **Result:** Burn radius collapse. Fireproof material combusted
- **Status:** Complete containment failure

---

## 🛡️ SUPPRESSION STRATEGY

- **Public Access:** Rerouted major hiking trails
- **Psychological Warfare:** Local legends encouraged to discourage visitation (e.g., "The Forest That Hunts Back")
- **Surveillance:** Drone surveillance re-established in 2023 using inverted lens optics
- **Perimeter Control:** Ongoing monitoring of temporal distortion fields
