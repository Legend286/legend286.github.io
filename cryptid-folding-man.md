# ENTITY DOSSIER – RIFTBORN CLASS: "THE FOLDING MAN"

**Entity Designation:** RB-01 // "The Folding Man"  
**Classification:** Riftborn // High Distortion Class  
**Threat Tier:** R-7 (Cognitive Hazard)  
**Containment Status:** Uncontained  
**Origin Point:** South Haven, Michigan (1983)  
**First Recorded Appearance:** Incident: VORTEX-SALT-FIELD-83  
**Compiled by:** Rift Phenomena Observation Cell (RPOC-4)  
**File ID:** RB-01-1983-PRIME

**→ Related Timeline:** See Era IV timeline for historical context of first contact incident.

## 🧬 PHENOTYPE DESCRIPTION

- **Apparent Structure:** Humanoid, approximately 2.1m tall.  
- **Visual Signature:** Subject appears bent and folded in non-Euclidean ways — limbs curving inward, torso doubling back through itself.  
- **Photonic Effect:** Optical sensors distort when attempting to capture the entity. Video footage is corrupted; analog film warps into spirals.

- **Locomotion:** The Folding Man does not walk. It “phases” forward in a flickering pattern, with limbs momentarily appearing behind itself.  
- **Spatial Signature:** Leaves behind inverted shadows on surfaces. Geiger counters spike inversely — lower radiation near its presence, higher farther out.

---

## 📡 OBSERVED ABILITIES

- **Spatial Inversion Field:** Subjects within 10 meters report extreme vertigo, hearing "bones snapping backwards," and being unable to describe the number of limbs the entity has.  
- **Temporal Displacement:** Timecodes from security footage at Incident Site show looping anomalies — multiple versions of the same timestamp.  
- **Memory Fracture:** Survivors of the 1983 contact describe remembering *future* events that did not occur.

## 📍 NOTABLE INCIDENTS

### 🧷 South Haven Breach – 1983  
- **Cover Story:** Chemical plant explosion  
- **Casualties:** 62 confirmed (27 dismembered without external trauma)  
- **Bureau Response:** First use of wide-scale amnestics  
- **Containment Attempt:** Failed. Rift distortion consumed containment grid within 38 seconds.  
- **Post-Event Discovery:** All wall clocks in the building stopped at **3:11 AM**, forward and backward simultaneously.

## 🧾 AGENT REPORT EXCERPT (FIELD LOG 1983)

> “He wasn’t walking. He was undoing walking.  
> You don’t see him — you see what he isn’t doing, and your brain panics trying to fill it in.  
> I think I watched him *exit the room before entering it.*  
> I think I watched myself die, and now I don’t know if it’s already happened.”

– Agent M. Dorrance, Interview Transcript (currently under observation)

## ⚠️ CONTAINMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Status:** Uncontained. No successful recontainment attempts recorded.  
- **Proposals Denied:**  
  - Use of temporal dampeners (caused feedback implosion at Black Site 11)  
  - Reality anchor deployment (entity bypassed field in four seconds)

- **Standing Order:** If Folding Man is sighted:
  - Clear civilian area within 1.2 km radius  
  - DO NOT ATTEMPT COMMUNICATION  
  - Record surroundings — not the entity

## 🔺 NOTES FROM THE ARCHIVE

> “He’s not bent. He’s folded. Like paper.  
> And you don’t fold something unless you’re trying to hide something *inside it.*”
