**KNOWN UNKNOWN: LORE DOSSIER**

---

### "They say history is written by the victors. But this history was buried by all of them."

Welcome to the world of **Known Unknown** — a veiled timeline of fractured records, classified operations, and bleeding cracks in the seams of reality. The names you've read in textbooks, the creatures whispered about in shadowed forests, the half-heard radio static at 3:11 AM — it’s all real.

But only some of it has been recovered.

# 🕵️‍♂️ INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS KNOWN UNKNOWN?

**KNOWN UNKNOWN** is a paranormal, conspiracy-infused alternate Earth setting blending modern folklore, shadow governments, haunted science, and interdimensional threats.

A world exists hidden behind redacted files, analog static, and the flicker of VHS footage. Here, nothing is entirely real — or fake. The truth is partitioned, archived, burned, then buried beneath a black site. What’s left is what they didn’t want you to see… or what refused to stay hidden.

This archive contains the buried history of mankind:
- The cryptids that watch through fogged windows.
- The agents who burned photographs to erase proof.
- The minds broken by contact with The Rift.
- The unexplainable machines buzzing in your dreams.

**KNOWN UNKNOWN** represents a living conspiracy. A fractured puzzle of historical what-ifs, classified documents, and whispered warnings, all orbiting a shared, shifting narrative.

> “They didn’t cover it up because it wasn’t real.
> They covered it up because it wouldn’t go away.”

## THE WORLD OF KNOWN UNKNOWN

Known Unknown takes place in a **parallel Earth**, almost identical to our own but seeded with anomalies from the start of human civilization. For millennia, powerful forces have worked behind the scenes to suppress, manipulate, or exploit these phenomena. 

### THE KNOWN
What people believe is real. Governments, history, media, science — the consensus world. But within it: surveillance, propaganda, experiments, and hidden truths.

### THE UNKNOWN
Creatures of folklore. Events erased from the news. Technology beyond its time. They live in the cracks of the world: abandoned towns, buried sites, forgotten VHS tapes.

Where they meet, you find the **Known Unknown** — the space where anomalies are real, but officially denied.

## FACTIONS & POWER BLOCS

### The Bureau
A monolithic, multinational black-budget intelligence agency. Controls vast archives of anomalous entities and experiments. Founded after World War II from remnants of Allied wartime research divisions.
- Known For: Surveillance, amnestics, counter-occult operations.
- Symbol: A triple-barred redacted stamp over a file folder.

### The Riftborn
Beings that do not belong to our dimension or chronology. Some are echoes of events that haven’t happened yet. Others slipped through when mankind cracked the veil.
- Known For: Reality-bending powers, instability, precognition.
- Symbol: An inverted triangle with a circle inside.

### The Lost Kin
Ancient creatures, cryptids, and spirits who once ruled forgotten landscapes. Many are awake again, stirred by human encroachment or summoned by cults.
- Known For: Territory control, ambushes, physical strength.
- Symbol: Antlers growing from a skull.

### The Unbound
Humanity’s worst reflections — haunted, possessed, driven mad. These include cursed objects, occult practitioners, and experimental subjects gone rogue.
- Known For: Resurrection, possession, ritual mechanics.
- Symbol: A stitched eye with threads pulled taut.

## KEY LOCATIONS

- **Black Site 11 (Nevada)**: Decommissioned nuclear test site. Now an off-grid vault housing artifacts deemed too dangerous to study.
- **Redwood Deep (Pacific Northwest)**: A forest that grows back overnight. Home to Birchskin, Doorlicker, and at least three known disappearances per month.
- **The Rift Observatory (Antarctica)**: Constructed in 1967, abandoned in 1973 after "The Static Incident." Reports claim it still transmits coordinates.
- **Operation Silence (Global)**: 1990s campaign to remove pre-digital cryptid photographs and videos from public archives.

## TIMELINE SNAPSHOTS

- **1902** – Tesla submits design for an energy broadcast tower that also attracts "a signal from outside known bands." His notes are confiscated.
- **1947** – The Bureau is formed. Publicly referred to as a Cold War intelligence initiative. Privately tasked with containing anomalous events.
- **1959** – The “Numbers Fiend” begins broadcasting coded threats via shortwave. Correlates with sudden blackouts and assassinations.
- **1983** – First confirmed Riftborn contact. Covered up as a chemical plant disaster.
- **2001** – The world almost learns the truth. Operation Declassification begins immediately. Memory wipes reach mass scale.

## OBJECTS OF INTEREST

- **SERUM X-7**: A bioagent that mutates cognitive pathways. Created to boost human potential; causes irreversible hallucinations and violent outbursts.
- **The Mirrorwitch**: First appeared in a shattered two-way mirror at a Bureau interrogation site. Whispers predictions in reverse.
- **Ragthrum**: A child's toy linked to multiple disappearances. Cries like its last owner. Authorities have never recovered two identical Ragthrums.
